= ACM Ansible playbooks

Playbooks and roles to:

 - Deploy and undeploy ACM operator and its resources. 
 - Import second cluster of DO480 lab
 - Delete MultiClusterHub
 - Delete ACM Operator
 


The objective is having automations for research phase that are also valid for preparing laboratories for each GE.

== Configuration of the Playbooks

 * All needed variables are referenced in the file `vars/main.yaml`.

 * Login to different clusters are made with `oc login` to avoid bringing differents kubeconfig from utility. Every playbook delete kubeconfig from workstation when finished to a clean env for student


== List of playbooks


[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Playbook
|Description
|Used Roles

|`acm_install`
|Installs ACM operator in `open-cluster-management` namespace, and waits for its deployments to be ready. Uses `kubeconfig` from 'utility' server
|
- `acm_install`


- `acm_clean_workstation`

|`acm_create_multiclusterhub`
|Instantiates a `MultiClusterHub`, the object that creates ACM console, resources and management hub. Waits for the object to be in phase `Running` (up to 20 minutes). Uses Secret `pull-secret` from the namespace `openshift-config`
|- `acm_create_multiclusterhub`



- `acm_clean_workstation`


|`acm_import_cluster2`
| Imports cluster `ocp4-mng.example.com` to ACM. It set label vendor=OpenShift to it, to add Observability addon
|
- `acm_import_cluster2`


- `acm_clean_workstation`

|`acm_add_observability`
| Add Observability resources needed for hub cluster and for all managed clusters.It cheks readiness of its deployments)
|
- `acm_add_observability`



- `acm_clean_workstation`


|`acm_remove_observability`
| Remove Observability resources. Not cheking deletion
|
- `acm_remove_observability`

- `acm_clean_workstation`



|`acm_remove_multiclusterhub`
| Deletes MultiClusterHub object and waits to complete deletion. First it tries to dettach second cluster
|
- `acm_dettach_cluster`

- `acm_remove_multiclusterhub`

- `acm_clean_workstation`

|`acm_remove`
| Remove the ACM Operator and all its objects. This playbook try to delete MCH WITHOUT previous dettaching of cluster2
|
 - `acm_remove`

 - `acm_remove_multiclusterhub`

 - `acm_clean_workstation`







|===

== Install ACM and import cluster
In the actual status of this playbooks, you can create a DO480 lab in rol-stage, clone this repo, and
 
```
cd $REPO/research/ansible && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_install.yaml && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_create_multiclusterhub.yaml && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_add_observability.yaml && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_import_cluster2.yaml 

```
This will provide you with ACM installed and cluster2 already imported in its MultiClusterHub. Observability will be activated

These are some of the times of differents executions of the playbooks, running in the DO480 lab with this sizing:

- 8 vCPUs and 32 GB of RAM for hub cluster

- 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of RAM for managed cluster

|===

 * Dettach a cluster means delete all resources in managed cluster,mainly `open-cluster-management-agent` and `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespaces and all its resources
 
 * When you delete MultiClusterHub the managed cluster `local_cluster` is implicitly dettached 

== Dettach Cluster and Uninstall ACM
 
```
cd $REPO/research/ansible && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_remove_multiclusterhub.yaml && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_remove.yaml 

```
In case you had not imported the second cluster, you can avoid first command and just run

```
cd $REPO/research/ansible && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_remove.yaml 
```
