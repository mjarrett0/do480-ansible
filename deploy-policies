 After you push your changes, you can deploy the policies to your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes installation. Post deployment, your hub cluster is connected to your Git repository. Any further changes to your chosen branch of the Git repository is reflected in your cluster.

Note: By default, policies deployed with GitOps use the merge reconcile option. If you want to use the replace reconcile option instead, add the apps.open-cluster-management.io/reconcile-option: replace annotation to the Subscription resource. See Application Lifecycle for more details.

The deploy.sh script creates Channel and Subscription resources in your hub cluster. The channel connects to the Git repository, and the subscription specifies the data to bring to the cluster through the channel. As a result, all policies defined in the specified subdirectory are created on your hub. After the policies are created by the subscription, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management analyzes the policies and creates additional policy resources in the namespace associated with each managed cluster that the policy is applied to, based on the defined placement rule.

The policy is then copied to the managed cluster from its respective managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster. As a result, the policies in your Git repository are pushed to all managed clusters that have labels that match the clusterSelector that are defined in the placement rule of your policy.
